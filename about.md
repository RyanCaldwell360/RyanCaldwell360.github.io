Hi! I’m Ryan Caldwell — a data scientist with a strong passion for solving real-world problems with data and machine learning.

Over the years, I’ve worked on data science projects that span sports analytics, healthcare and insurance. Lately, I’ve become especially excited about the field of **recommendation systems** — how we can use behavioral data, collaborative patterns, and personalization to help people discover what matters most to them.

This portfolio is a hands-on space where I share my exploration into the world of recommenders and other types of data science problems.

Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast, recruiter, or just curious, feel free to explore the [projects](projects.html) and [blog](blog.html). I hope it gives you a window into how I think, build, and learn.

Thanks for stopping by!
